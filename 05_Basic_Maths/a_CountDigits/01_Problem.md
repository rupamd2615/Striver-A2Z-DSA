Problem statement
-----------------
[Practice Here](https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/count-digits_8416387?leftPanelTabValue=PROBLEM) \
You are given a number **_’n’_**.

  

Find the number of digits of ‘n’ that evenly divide ‘n’.

  

**Note:**

    A digit evenly divides ‘n’ if it leaves no remainder when dividing ‘n’.
    

  

**Example:**

    Input: ‘n’ = 336
    
    Output: 3
    
    Explanation:
    336 is divisible by both ‘3’ and ‘6’. Since ‘3’ occurs twice it is counted two times.
    

**Note:**

    You don’t need to print anything. Just implement the given function.
    

  

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )

**Input format:**

    The first line of input contains an integer ‘n’.
    

  

**Output Format:**

    Return an integer as described in the problem statement.
    

  

**Note**

    You don’t need to print anything, it has already been taken care of, just complete the given function.
    

**Sample Input 1:**

    35
    

  

**Sample Output 1:**

    1
    

  

**Explanation of sample output 1:**

    35 is only divisible by ‘5’, hence answer is 1.
    

  

**Sample Input 2:**

    373
    

  

**Sample Output 2:**

    0
    

  

**Explanation of sample output 2:**

    There’s no digit in 373 that evenly divides it. Hence the output is 0.
    

  

**Expected Time Complexity:**

    Try to solve this in O(log(n)) 
    

  

**Constraints:**

    1 <= ‘n’ <= 10^9
    
    Time Limit: 1 sec
